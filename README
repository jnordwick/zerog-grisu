A Java implementation of the Florian Loitsch's Grisu2 algorithm for printing
floating point numbers with only integer arithmetic. Fast and almost
alawys correct :)

No garbage is created per call. Possibly a little on startup.

Author's Node: This is not very Java-ish code. It uses some hacks to make sure
everything gets done in native types and no garbage is created and to work
around Java's lack of unsigned integers. All these could be solved if Java
had no-overhead value objects on the stack. Valhalla is working on them I
hear, but that is a Java 10 feature at the earliest :(

I'm trying to get the rest of the Zero-G Logging out sometime soon, but it
has to be ripped from a larger zero-g library.
